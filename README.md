# ML_Binary_classification_click_on_Ad
This project aimed to generate different machine learning models to predict whether a user will click on an advertisement or not. 
The data consisted of ten variables with about a thousand entries for each variable. The data was cleaned, categorical features were transformed into numerical data and the correlation between the features and the target (click on ad) was calculated. Features with low correlation were excluded from the ML model calculations. The project corresponded to a binary classification and the ML models chosen were: Logistic Regression Model, Naive Bayes Classifier, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest. For models requiring normalisation, RobustScaler normalisation was applied, as the feature distributions were asymmetric and had outliers. After training the models on 80% of the dataset and testing them on the remaining 20%, the best performing model was the logistic regression model, with an accuracy of 0.943 on the test set. The rest of the models also showed good predictive power, as their accuracy was higher than 0.92. Due to the high accuracy and interpretability of the result, the logistic regression model should be considered as the most suitable for predictions in this dataset.
